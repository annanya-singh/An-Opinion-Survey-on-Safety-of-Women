# An-Opinion-Survey-on-Safety-of-Women
This project utilizes opinion surveys to assess women's safety using Fisher's Exact Test and Multinomial Regression. The former handles small sample sizes and identifies significant associations, while the latter examines multiple factors influencing safety perceptions. Tools used include MS Excel, MS Word, and STATA.
Ensuring the safety and well-being of women is a critical concern in society. Opinion surveys play a vital role in capturing public sentiment and understanding perceptions related to this important issue. Fisher's Exact Test accommodates small sample sizes, which are often encountered in targeted surveys. It accounts for the categorical nature of the variables, enabling the assessment of significant associations. The test provides p-values, which quantify the statistical significance of the observed associations, aiding decision-making processes.The application of the Fisher Exact Test in analyzing opinion surveys on the safety of women contributes to a comprehensive understanding of this critical societal issue. By uncovering significant associations between demographic characteristics and opinions, policymakers and organizations can identify areas of concern and tailor interventions accordingly, ultimately fostering safer environments for women. Multinomial Regression accommodates the inclusion of multiple independent variables, facilitating a comprehensive examination of various factors contributing to safety perceptions. It provides estimates of odds ratios, allowing for the interpretation of the strength and direction of associations. The analysis offers insights into the relative importance of different independent variables in predicting the categories of the dependent variable. The application of multinomial regression analysis in analyzing opinion surveys on women's safety enhances our understanding of this critical societal issue. By identifying significant associations between demographic variables and safety perceptions, policymakers and organizations can develop targeted interventions and policies that address the specific concerns and needs of diverse groups of women. This approach contributes to the creation of safer environments and promotes the well-being of women in society. 
This project was done using MS Excel, MS Word and STATA.
